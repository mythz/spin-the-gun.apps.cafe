Create a detailed plan to create a beautiful, fun and engaging game with React + Vite + TypeScript which supports statically hosted file deployments so it can only utilize Browser Storage, e.g. IndexedDB, localStorage. The plan should be detailed enough for a LLM to be able to build the entire implementation from it. Here is the description of the game:

you have to spin a revolver and whoever it lands on gets to shoot anybody. there are 4 ai bots (not including the player) and ai bots can shoot each other. there is a 1 in 2 chance that the shot is a blank. if you try to shoot an ai bot with a blank when it comes to the ai bot's turn it will try and shoot you. 40 : 60 chance you will get to shoot
